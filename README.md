A small clone of [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048), a small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Join the elements and get to the tile with 256 isotopic mass! Watch out for unstable elements though, as these won't be around forever!
